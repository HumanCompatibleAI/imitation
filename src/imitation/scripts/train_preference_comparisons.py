    """Train a reward model using preference comparisons.

    Args:
        _seed: Random seed.
        normalize: If True, then rescale observations and reward.
        normalize_kwargs: kwargs for `VecNormalize`.
        total_timesteps: number of environment interaction steps
        total_comparisons: number of preferences to gather in total
        comparisons_per_iteration: number of preferences to gather at once (before
            switching back to agent training). This doesn't impact the total number
            of comparisons that are gathered, only the frequency of switching
            between preference gathering and agent training.
        fragment_length: number of timesteps per fragment that is used to elicit
            preferences
        transition_oversampling: factor by which to oversample transitions before
            creating fragments. Since fragments are sampled with replacement,
            this is usually chosen > 1 to avoid having the same transition
            in too many fragments.
        trajectory_path: either None, in which case an agent will be trained
            and used to sample trajectories on the fly, or a path to a pickled
            sequence of TrajectoryWithRew to be trained on
        save_preferences: if True, store the final dataset of preferences to disk.
        agent_path: if given, initialize the agent using this stored policy
            rather than randomly.
        reward_trainer_kwargs: passed to CrossEntropyRewardTrainer
        gatherer_kwargs: passed to SyntheticGatherer
        rl: parameters for RL training, used for restoring agents.
        allow_variable_horizon: If False (default), algorithm will raise an
            exception if it detects trajectories of different length during
            training. If True, overrides this safety check. WARNING: variable
            horizon episodes leak information about the reward via termination
            condition, and can seriously confound evaluation. Read
            https://imitation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide/variable_horizon.html
            before overriding this.

    Returns:
        Rollout statistics from trained policy.

    Raises:
        FileNotFoundError: Path corresponding to saved policy missing.
        ValueError: Inconsistency between config and deserialized policy normalization.
