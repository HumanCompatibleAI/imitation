    "# Train an Agent using Behavior Cloning\n",
    "\n",
    "Behavior cloning is the most naive approach to imitation learning. \n",
    "We take the transitions of trajectories taken by some expert and use them as training samples to train a new policy.\n",
    "The method has many drawbacks and often does not work. \n",
    "However in this example, where we use an agent for the seals/CartPole-v0 environment, it is feasible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we use a variant of the CartPole environment from the seals package, which has fixed episode durations. Read more about why we do this [here](https://imitation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/main-concepts/variable_horizon.html)."
