    "# Train an Agent using Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of generative adversarial imitation learning is to train a discriminator network to distinguish between expert trajectories and learner trajectories.\n",
    "The learner is trained using a traditional reinforcement learning algorithm such as PPO and is rewarded for trajectories that make the discriminator think that it was an expert trajectory."
