Installation from PyPI
----------------------

To install the latest PyPI release, simply run:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install imitation


Installation from source
------------------------

Installation from source is useful if you wish to contribute to the development of ``imitation``, or if you need features that have not yet been made available in a stable release:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone http://github.com/HumanCompatibleAI/imitation
    cd imitation
    pip install -e .

There are also a number of dependencies used for running tests and building the documentation, which can be installed with:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install -e ".[dev]"
