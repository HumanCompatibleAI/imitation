Code of Conduct
===============

To ensure that the imitation community remains open and inclusive, we have a few ground rules that we ask contributors to adhere to. This isn't an exhaustive list of things that you can't do. Rather, take it in the spirit in which it's intended â€” a guide to make it easier to enrich all of us and the technical communities in which we participate.


* **Be friendly and patient**.
* **Be welcoming**. We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, colour, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.
* **Be considerate**. Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when making decisions. Remember that we're a world-wide community, so you might not be communicating in someone else's primary language.
* **Be respectful**. Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. Members of the imitation community should be respectful when dealing with other members as well as with people outside the imitation community.
* **Be careful in the words that you choose**. We are a community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren't acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:

  * Violent threats or language directed against another person.
  * Discriminatory jokes and language.
  * Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
  * Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying information without their consent ("doxing").
  * Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.
  * Unwelcome sexual attention.
  * Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
  * Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.

* **When we disagree, try to understand why**. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Focus on helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.
