Imitation
=========

**Imitation provides clean implementations of imitation and reward learning algorithms**, under a unified and user-friendly API.
Currently, we have implementations of Behavioral Cloning, `DAgger <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1011.0686.pdf>`_
(with synthetic examples), density-based reward modeling, `Maximum Causal Entropy Inverse Reinforcement Learning <https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~bziebart/publications/maximum-causal-entropy.pdf>`_,
`Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning <https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.11248>`_,
`Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning <https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03476>`_, and
`Deep RL from Human Preferences <https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03741>`_.

You can find us on GitHub at http://github.com/HumanCompatibleAI/imitation.


Main Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Built on and compatible with Stable Baselines 3 (SB3).
- Modular Pytorch implementations of Behavioral Cloning, DAgger, GAIL, and AIRL that can
  train arbitrary SB3 policies.
- GAIL and AIRL have customizable reward and discriminator networks.
- Scripts to train policies using SB3 and save rollouts from these policies as synthetic "expert" demonstrations.
- Data structures and scripts for loading and storing expert demonstrations.
